# Task

Develop a web page that connects to a remote API, downloads a dataset, displays a table with the downloaded dataset, and provides some basic search and filter functions.

In particular, the web page should:

- Request the data located at `https://api.baubuddy.de/dev/index.php/v1/tasks/select` from PHP
- Display the downloaded data in a table showing `task`, `title`, `description` and `colorCode`. The displayed HTML element for the `colorCode` should have its color set accordingly
- Create a search which allows searching for any of the data in the table
- Implement auto-refresh functionality which requests the data from above every 60 minutes and updates the table with the new data without reloading the web page
- Outside the table, create a button that opens a modal. In this modal, there should be another button that allows you to select any image from the file system. When you have selected the image, it will be displayed in the modal
  - Note that this is not linked to the data from above
